<h3>COOKIES AND OTHER TOOLS</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li>LuminoLens collects information about You by using cookies, tracking pixels, web beacons and other technologies (collectively, “Tools”). We use this information to better understand, customize and improve User experience with Our websites, services and offerings as well as to manage Our advertising. This information can make Your use of Our products and services easier and more meaningful by allowing LuminoLens to provide better service, customize sites based on consumer preferences, compile statistics, provide You with more relevant advertisements based on Your interests, analyze trends and otherwise administer and improve Our LuminoLens Services. If We have collected Your Personal Information, We may associate this personal data with information gathered through the Tools.
    <br><br>
<li>Your web browser can be set to allow You to control whether You will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify You each time a cookie is sent to Your browser. If Your browser is set to reject cookies, websites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize You when You return to the website, and some website functionality may be lost. The Help section of Your browser may tell You how to prevent Your browser from accepting cookies.
    <br><br>
<li>In furtherance of clause 3 of this Privacy Policy, the following information is collected when visiting Our Website:
    <br><ol type="i">
<li>Log data: When You use Our Website, our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”), including information that Your browser sends whenever You visit Our Website. This log data may include Your Internet Protocol address, the address of the webpages You visited that had LuminoLens features, browser type and settings, the date and time of Your request, how You used websites and cookie data.
    <br>
<li>Cookie data: Depending on how You are accessing LuminoLens services, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by Your computer each time You visit our sites, unique to Your LuminoLens account or Your browser) or similar technologies, to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until You close Your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until You and/or Your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to remember Your personal preferences, such as sections of the Website that You visit frequently, Your user ID, or other settings so You do not have to set them up every time You visit, and we may use cookies to serve You relevant advertising tailored to Your interests. Some of the cookies we use are associated with Your LuminoLens account (including Personal Information about You, such as the email address You gave us), and other cookies are not.
    <br>
<li>Social media plugins and data. In addition, Our Website may use social media plugins (e.g., the Facebook "Like" button, '"Share to Twitter"' button) to enable You to easily share information with others. When You visit any of our online LuminoLens services, the operator of the social plugin can place a cookie on Your computer, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our websites. If You are logged into the social media website (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google+) while browsing on our LuminoLens services, the social plugins allow that social media website to receive information that You have visited our LuminoLens services. The social plugins also allow the social media website to share information about Your activities on Our Website with other users of their social media website. LuminoLens does not control any of the content from the social plugins. For more information about social plugins from other social media websites You should refer to those sites' privacy and data sharing statements.

<br>If You choose to link Your social media or Google account to LuminoLens, this allows Us to obtain information from those accounts (such as Your friends or contacts). The information We obtain from these services often depends on Your settings or the applicable provider's privacy policies, so please check these policies before granting Us access. You agree that We are not responsible for any acts or omissions by these social media service providers. If You give Us permission to access this information, We will use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<li>Device information. In addition to log data, We may also collect information about the device You are using to access Our services, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether We collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device You are using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether You are using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information Your device may make available to us, please also check the policies of Your device manufacturer or software provider.
    <br>
<li>Interest Based Advertising. LuminoLens hopes to deliver to You advertising for products and services You need or want. LuminoLens uses common tracking tools, such as cookies, pixels, web beacons, and similar technologies, to automatically collect information about Users for purposes of enhancing their online experience and delivering more meaningful advertisements. Like many companies, LuminoLens may also utilize third-party advertising vendors and other partners to collect this information.

    <br>Like most companies, We place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers. One way We do so is by allowing network advertising companies with whom We work to place their own Tools when an individual visits LuminoLens Website. This enables the network advertising company to recognize individuals who have previously visited LuminoLens Website and to serve You ads based on Your web browsing activity, purchases, interests and/or other information—a practice commonly referred to as interest-based advertising (“IBA”) or online behavioral advertising (“OBA”). These advertising companies may also use these types of technologies to recognize You across the devices You use, such as a mobile phone or a laptop, and serve You ads on websites You visit and applications You use.
    <br>
<li>Retargeting. One way in which we deliver more meaningful advertisements is through a common form of online advertising known as “retargeting” or “remarketing.” Retargeting works by serving ads on one site based on an individual’s online activities on a different, unrelated site. For example, if You look at LuminoLens products on an LuminoLens website, You may later see an advertisement for LuminoLens products when You visit third-party sites. To do this, LuminoLens or its advertising vendors may use a device ID, cookie, pixel, web beacon or similar technology placed by LuminoLens or our third-party vendor when You visit Our Website or third-party websites or apps. The placing of these cookies or other technologies on Your device may enable You to be identified across multiple websites. You should consult the privacy policies of our vendors and other websites that You visit to understand how they collect and use Your data.<br><br>
</ol></ol>

<br><br><h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>
<ol type="i">

<li> Please note that this policy is in accordance with the Information Technology Act, 2000 (“IT Act”) and rules thereunder. Rule 4(1) of the Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011 (“Data Protection Rules”) requires body corporates to have a privacy policy in place and published on its website. The consent for use/processing of the SPDI is usually obtained by having such person accept the terms of the body corporate’s privacy policy.
<br>
<li>Rule 3 of the Data Protection Rules defines sensitive personal data or information (“SPDI”) of a person to mean such personal information which consists of information relating to (i) password; (ii) financial information such as bank account or credit card or debit card or other payment instrument details; (iii) physical, physiological and mental health condition; (iv) sexual orientation; (v) medical records and history; (vi) biometric information. Thus, a person’s personal information, such as medical history and physiological conditions, are considered SPDI under the Data Protection Rules. When a body corporate (i.e. any company and includes a firm, sole proprietorship or other association of individuals engaged in commercial or professional activities, per Section 43A of the IT Act) collects, stores, transfers or processes such information, certain requirements under the Data Protection Rules are triggered.
    <br>
<li>Rule 5(3) of the Data Protection Rules provides that while collecting information directly from the person concerned, the body corporate or any person on its behalf shall take such steps as are, in the circumstances, reasonable to ensure that the person concerned is having the knowledge of (a) the fact that the information is being collected; (b) the purpose for which the information is being collected; (c) the intended recipients of the information; and (d) the name and address of (i) the agency that is collecting the information; and (ii) the agency that will retain the information. Request the company to please confirm if this information is collected and its purpose.
    <br>
<li>Rule 5(5) of the Data Protection Rules provides that the information collected shall be used for the purpose for which it has been collected.
    <br>
<li>Rule 7 of the Data Protection Rules provides that a body may transfer SPDI to any other body corporate or a person in India, or located in any other country, that ensures the same level of data protection that is adhered to by the body corporate as provided for under these rules. The transfer may be allowed only if it is necessary for the performance of the lawful contract between the body corporate and provider of information or where such person has consented to data transfer.
    <br>
<li>Request the company to please include the hyperlink to the terms of use herein.
    <br>
<li>This is in accordance with Rule 3 (1) (h) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (“Intermediary Rules”).
    <br>
<li>There are requirements such as allowing users to opt-out (Rule 5(7) of the Data Protection Rules) or modify (Rule 5(7) of the Data Protection Rules) their SPDI if required.
    <br>
<li>The Data Protection Rules also mandate the implementation of reasonable security practices and procedures in order to keep the SPDI secure. This requirement is fulfilled if the body corporate conforms to the international standard IS/ISO/IEC 27001 on “Information Technology – Security Techniques – Information Security Management System – Requirements” or similar standards that are approved and notified by the Central Government. As on date, no such standards have been notified.
    <br>
<li>There is a requirement to appoint a ‘Grievance Officer’ (Rule 5(9) of the Data Protection Rules), whose contact details are to be published on the website. Request LuminoLens to please designate a Grievance Officer and include his name and contact details herein.
    <br>
<li>This is in accordance with Rules 3 (1) (c) and 3 (1) (f) of the Intermediary Rules.
